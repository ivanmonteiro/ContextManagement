# EFManagement

Author: **Ivan Monteiro Cantalice**

Context Management for Entity Framework provides reusable UnitOfWork, Repository, SessionStorage, MVC Transaction Attribute for individual controller's actions.

## Motivation

Building apps with Entity Framework I needed  code reusability among projects for common design patterns like Repository and UnitOfWork. 

For ASP.NET MVC I needed a way to manage contexts among repositories and control over transactions using Transaction attribute for actions.
