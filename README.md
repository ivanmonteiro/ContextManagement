# ContextManagement

Author: **Ivan Monteiro Cantalice**

Context Management for Entity Framework provides reusable UnitOfWork, Repository, SessionStorage, MVC Transaction Attribute for individual controller's actions.

## Motivation

Building apps with Entity Framework I needed more granular control over transactions using ASP.NET MVC and code reusability among projects for things lole Repository boilerplate, UnitOfWork pattern and transaction attribute for asp.net mvc controllers. This is a library that I built to use on some projects, now open source!
